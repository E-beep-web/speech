# Speech-to-Text Translation Project

This project converts spoken input into text and translates it into different languages using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to be a simple, user-friendly tool for real-time speech recognition and translation.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition:** Converts spoken words into text using browser-based APIs.
- **Language Support:** Supports multiple languages for both speech recognition and translation.
- **User Interface:** Interactive and responsive design built with HTML and CSS.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Structuring the web application.
- **CSS:** Styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Implementing speech recognition and translation logic.

## How It Works
1. The user selects a target language for translation.
2. The application uses the Web Speech API to listen to the user's speech and converts it into text.
3. The recognized text is sent to the translation API, which translates it into the chosen language.
4. The translated text is displayed on the screen.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
